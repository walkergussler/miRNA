## Files present:
2 sets of test files - small ones to test installation issues, and larger ones for classification
Additionally, there are 3 scripts. You can run this program as a regular command line scientific script with CLI.py
You could also set up a server and a client and perform operations remotely through a server if you wish.
Enjoy!
